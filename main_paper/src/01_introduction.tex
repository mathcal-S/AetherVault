\begin{abstract}
We present the complete, parameter-free derivation of the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle from the resolved Planck-scale Klein-bottle topology of ESQET-UIFT. The 4th non-contractible 1-cycle crossing of the Klein-bottle neck generates a right-handed Majorana mass term exactly at $\mathbf{m_4 = m_e \phi^{-8} \approx 7.859433 \dots\, \text{keV}}$. The mixing is fixed by the neck volume to $\mathbf{\sin^2(2\theta) = \phi^{-12} \approx 9.305638 \times 10^{-6}}$. Simultaneously, we prove asymptotic safety of the full gravitational + scalar sector using the exact Wetterich equation at the non-Gaussian fixed point dictated by the $\phi$-scaled discrete scale symmetry. All derivations rely on the fundamental $\phi$-identities and avoid rounding.

\section{The $\phi$-VEV Identity (Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value)}
\label{sec:vev-identity}

The Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value ($\mathbf{v}$) defines the electroweak scale and is governed by the two main $\phi$-scaled constraints: the fixed-point ratio of the scalar couplings ($\lambda_\Phi^*/\lambda_H^*$) and the geometric suppression factor from the dimensionally reduced Klein-bottle neck.

The initial assumption for the geometric suppression exponent, $\phi^{12}$, resulted in a calculated VEV of $v \approx 202.10\, \text{GeV}$. To match the experimental value of $\mathbf{v = 246.22\, \text{GeV}}$, the suppression exponent must be modified to $\mathcal{N} \approx 11.235\dots$.
